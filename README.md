# pet-portal
hackbright fullstack project

The MVP of my project, which is a pet portal app with user registration, reviews, and dog park/movie information, should include the core features and functionality that make your app usable and valuable to its users. 

1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - User can create an account with a pet name, email, and password.
   - User can log in to their account.

2. Dog Park Information:
   - Display a list of dog parks with names, locations (latitude and longitude).
   - Users can view details of a dog park, including its name and location.
   - Users can leave reviews for a dog park, including a rating and optional comments.

3. Dog Movie Information:
   - Display a list of dog movies with titles, ratings, and comments.
   - Users can view details of a dog movie, including its title, rating, and comments.
   - Users can associate a dog movie with a specific dog park.

4. User Profile:
   - Users have a profile page where they can view and edit their pet name and email.
   - Users can see the reviews they've submitted.

5. Database Integration:
   - Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database (already created with the necessary tables).

6. Basic Styling and Layout:
   - Apply basic styles and layout using Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks to make the app visually presentable.

7. Error Handling:
   - Implement basic error handling for scenarios like incorrect login credentials, duplicate email addresses, etc.

8. Registration and Login Flow:
   - Ensure a smooth registration and login flow for users.

9. Navigation: (Pending)
   - Implement a navigation menu or links to navigate (e.g., home, dog parks, dog movies, user profile).
