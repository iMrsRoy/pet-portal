# pet-portal
hackbright fullstack project

The MVP of my project, which is a pet portal app with user registration, dog_parks, dog_movies, dog_games.

1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - User can create an account with a pet name, email, and password.
   - User can log in to their account.

2. Dog Park Information:
   - Display dog parks with locations pinned in google Map (latitude and longitude).
   - Users can view weather using zipcode to see it they can go for a walk with dog.

3. Dog Movie Information:
   - Display a list of dog movies with titles, ratings, and comments.
   - Users can view details of a dog movie, including its title, rating, and comments.

5. Database Integration:
   - Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database (already created with the necessary tables).

6. Basic Styling and Layout:
   - Apply basic styles and layout using Bootstrap or other CSS frameworks to make the app visually presentable.

7. Registration and Login Flow:
   - Ensure a smooth registration and login flow for users.

8. Navigation:
   - Implemented a navigation menu or links to navigate (e.g., dog_parks, dog_movies, dog_games, logout).
